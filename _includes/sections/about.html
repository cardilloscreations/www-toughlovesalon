      Difficult Decisions
    </h3>
    <blockquote cite="{{ site.url }}">
      Business was good when Lisa and Ray moved to Florida, but then COVID-19 hit, which disrupted all their plans.
      Lisa planned on commuting to Maryland monthly, but she ended up being the only stylist, and needed to commute weekly to keep the salon running.
      She flew between Florida and Maryland weekly for almost four years.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote cite="{{ site.url }}">
      Recently, Ray and Lisa have both experienced some health problems and scares, and the travel was becoming especially difficult.
      Lisa needed to have a surgery that required 6-8 weeks of recovery, so they refocused their efforts to sell the salon.
      During her recovery, several sales inquiries came in, and one of them was qualified enough to release them from the lease.
